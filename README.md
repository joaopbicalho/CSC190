## SeamCarving
Image processing tool that resizes images in a content-aware manner such that most interesting features of the image are preserved.
Image uploaded to the program is reduced in size by one vertical path of connected pixels for each iteration and user is able to run it up to a desired reduced size.

## autocomplete
Designed a fast implementation of the auto-complete functionality where given a query string the program returns the
top match that completes the partial word based on a database of terms with associated importance weight.

## AVLtrees
Implementation of the function  is_avl_tree() which takes in a pointer to a BST, and returns True if the BST is an AVL tree and function bag_insert_norot() which inserts an element into a BST without performing any rotations. 

## ImageColorModifier
You can make an image brighter by multiplying all the pixel values by a constant larger than 1; and you can make an image darker by multiplying all the pixel values by a constant smaller than one. This program allows the user to change the level of brightness of an image by multiplying all the pixels by any given constant.

## LinkedListImplementation
Inlcudes a header file for operating on linked lists (includes inserting a value, deleting a node with a specified value, and freeing the entire linked list and a c file that implents all the functions declared in the header file

## StringFunctions
Includes an original implementation of the strcat and atoi functions, which appends a source string to a destination string and convert a string to integer respectively. It also includes a recursive version of the strcmp function and an implementation floyd's cycle-finding algorithm for a linked list.

## LinkedListFunctions
Program containing different functions relating to manipulation of linked lists. Includes a function that prints out all the data in the linked list with only int data using recursion and not using recursion, and implementation a linked list (with print and append) that can store objects of type type int, float, and double.

## InsertionSort
Implementation of a function that implements Insertion Sort in an array.
